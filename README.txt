This game uses the pygame module to run and display a game of chess. 
It is launched by running: 

python3 ChessBoard.py

on a terminal or console window. This should open a menu. Currently, 
only the player vs. player option has been implemented, but AI is
being worked on and will hopefully be added in the future. Requires
the pygame module which can be installed by using pip to run:

pip install pygame
